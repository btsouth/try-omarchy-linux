"""Carry out a plan, keeping a journal so an interrupted import can resume.

Before anything that replaces a file on this computer, the original is copied
to a private backup folder. Every file the importer writes is recorded in an
append-only journal (size, mtime and hash of what was written), and a
replacement is recorded as pending before it happens. A later run uses the
journal to recognise its own earlier work, so it never recreates something
the user deleted after importing, and never overwrites a later edit.
